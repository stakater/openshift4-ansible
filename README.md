# openshift4-ansible
Setup Openshift4 via ansible
=======
This repo holds some example playbooks that can be chained together to do the following:

- Deploy OpenShift 4.x via IPI
- Bootstrap the Openshift-GitOps operator and the initial app-of-apps 

There are also example scripts for setting up the bastion or "ansible node" and for bootstrapping the sealed secrets controller.
